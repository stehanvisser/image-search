# Important step to follow:

This project needs a Google Custom API KEY.

If you already have a GOOGLE API KEY:

1. Create .env.local file in your main directory.
2. Add in .env.local REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY='{YOUR API KEY}'.

If you do not have a GOOGLE API KEY you can create:

1. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and either login or create an google account.
2. On the side navigation go to Credentials. To navigate to the Credentials page. https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
3. On the Credentials page, click Create credentials > API key. The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.
4. Click Close. The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys. (Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)

Notes:
Ensure your Custom api services is active and is using the correct key.
You will have to create Create credentials for your application before the key will be active.

API introduction can be found at https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
